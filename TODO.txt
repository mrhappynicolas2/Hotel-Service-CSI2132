In SearchServlet:
        Fix the way information is showed, this can be done by seperating the results that are made and then creating a section for each in the table
        Change the way you search for stuff (if you insert nothing into a search bar, it will search for other aspects instead)
        Add buttons and stuff like that
        Right now it will search the name of a hotel with the exact name and will search for the number_hotels which is > then what you typed

In Application:
    Change the way the selectFromTable function works, right now you cant use the LIKE command

In ReservationServlet: 
    -fix ReservationViewServlet

SQL:
	Change "agreement" to have a foreign key connected to client and rooms
		might cause a issue since instead of null, 0 was used
	change Adress to be a multi-variable
