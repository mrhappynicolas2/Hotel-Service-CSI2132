In SearchServlet:
        Fix the way information is showed, this can be done by seperating the results that are made and then creating a section for each in the table
        Change the way you search for stuff (if you insert nothing into a search bar, it will search for other aspects instead)
        Add buttons and stuff like that
        Right now it will search the name of a hotel with the exact name and will search for the number_hotels which is > then what you typed

In Application:
    Change the way the selectFromTable function works, right now you cant use the LIKE command

In LoginServlet:
    Make it so it saves all information at all times

In ReservationServlet: 
    -Add the servlets that are connected to the buttons (or change the way they work)

General:
We need a way to automaticly login into the database: Curretnly this is done by singing in as the database (username is postgres, password is your password)
We also need a way to do roles, im too lazy to add a way to add roles, so we could just add 2 roles to the database 
    -problem of doing it this way: do we have 2 sets of HTML files, 1 for users and for employees?
    -or do we have 1 set, but use if statements to check what your role is
