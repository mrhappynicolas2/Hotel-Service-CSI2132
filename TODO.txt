In SearchServlet:
        Fix the way information is showed, this can be done by seperating the results that are made and then creating a section for each in the table
DONE -  Make it so it keeps the information(username and password) from when you login so that you can acess the database
        Change the way you search for stuff (if you insert nothing into a search bar, it will search for other aspects instead)
        Add buttons and stuff like that
        Right now it will search the name of a hotel with the exact name and will search for the number_hotels which is > then what you typed

        In Application:
            Change the way the selectFromTable function works, right now you cant use the LIKE command

        In LoginServlet:
            Make it so it saves all information at all times

        There are many other stuff to add!
