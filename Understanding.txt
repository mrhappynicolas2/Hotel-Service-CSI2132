1) First step is to login into the database (username "postgres", password being your password)

2A)  Now that you are logged in you can either search for a room (still in progress)

2B) Or you can go to the "Employee section" this section can be used to search for the agreements
B2) After getting to the employee section, you need to login as a employee, currently this is done by having any username, 
    But having the password "admin"
B3) After having connected with the employee credentials, You can now search for a agreementID
B4) After having searched for a agreement ID, you can either deny or accept the agreement


How the servlet work:

AdminServlet: is used for logging in as the employee in section B
EmployeeServlet: is not currently being used
LoginServlet: is used to login as the database (username:postgres, password:UNIQUE)
LogoutServlet: is used to logout of the database (just resets the username and password)
ReservationServlet: Is used to search for the reservationID's, can then use the 3 buttons to deny, accept or view
SearchServlet: is used to search for a specific room (still in progress)

DenyReservationServlet      :
AcceptReservationServlet    : These have not been implemented yet, but they will be used to __ a reservation
ViewReservationServlet      :

Application.java is used for connecting to the database
