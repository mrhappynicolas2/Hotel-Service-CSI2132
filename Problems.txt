In application.selectFromTable(4 variables):
    if the query returns a null, it will go array out of bound, to fix this I break out of the for loop at line 266
    What this means is: if there a null, the value will not be read. this does not matter if the null is at the end, 
    but if its anywhere else, then the query will be offset by that null value 
    
    Ex: RoomNum:1, room_type:null, room_status:'clear' will become roomNum:1, room_type:'clear' |room_status is not returned|

    This is a problem because the agreement_num is sometimes null, this might cause some problmes latter

    Using * in the select all will not work
